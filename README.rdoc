I am attempting to add actors to my movie pages. Right now, I'm deciding between using a join table and adding a column. I guess I'm not so sure how to go about deciding which is necessary. Meaning I need to learn more about join tables and adding columns. My take is to simply use the search results (which provides cast_members) and put them into the Show.html.erb file for my movie views.
